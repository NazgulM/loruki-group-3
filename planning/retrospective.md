# Retrospective

## What was not clear, where did you get stuck

- In the css, where you put your script matters, when ever we write scripts that
  target a specific area, other areas change unless we move the script somewhere
  else within the css file.
- We still do not understand where exactly we should place scripts on the go, we
  still take a trial and error approach to it.

## what was clear, what did you master or improve

- **Effective communication**. We had less meetings these two weeks combined
  than we had when we worked on the other project before. At first you might
  think that was a bad thing, and well maybe it is not the best thing to do.
  However the few meetings we had were brief and effective enough that we
  finished our project four days before the deadline and had plenty of time for
  experimenting with the colors and animations.

- How to make a web page responsive, I think we have understood the concept and
  the `css` of making a wab page responsive depending on the size of the screen.

## Where can we still use some help

- **`css`and`html`**.
- `css grid` and `css flex`
- we barely use discussions in github

## Where can we still help others move forward

- Communication, you can solve a problem by intellect and being pushy but you
  can not do it consistently. Tyranny is like anti-pain drug, a short term fix
  for a long term problem. The key to getting through a problem is by letting
  people demonstrate their creative potential which can only happen if you let
  people do what ever the hell they want provided they agree to certain
  guideline or understand what the goal really is. The key to effective
  communication is very simple, creating a win-win situation between the
  individual team member and the group as a whole.
